We have a working prototype!

Accomplished:
-can now start the program (assuming cam is properly oriented) and display as a rectilinear scene
-can "pan" rectilinear view-frame via arrow keys
-<escape> ends program, <arrow keys> pan, and <r> resets viewframe


TODO:
-make panning with arrow keys smoother (holding them down is glitchy and weird)
-get a working facial recognition demo
-coordinate facial recognition demo to work with fisheye view
-link facial recognition program to rectilinear viewframe
-create in/out panning via perceived eye distance (i.e. how far the user is from the camera)
-create a "orientation" phase at the beginning, that shows you where to put the fisheye (no warping), adjusts radius, and tells you when it's correctly placed
